This is a complete clone of popular OTT app Netflix implemented using the MERN stack. Rather than using a third party api I have built an api completely from scratch using node and express and for databsae I have used MongoDB. The app supports user authentication using JWT. The frontend is built using React and for styling I have used sass. Other than the things mentioned above the home screen of the app shows all the movies or the series that are present in the database. When a user clicks a particular movie or series the user is directed to a new page showing the trailer of the movie using a npm package React Player that allows us to directly show any youtube video in our react app.
